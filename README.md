# Multiplayer tic-tac-toe on the terminal

## How it works
See [javadoc](https://pnguyen72.github.io/MyGame/MyGame/MyGame.html).

## How to play
Start the [server](/src/code/MyGame/Server/MainServer.java) and keep it running, 
then start the [program](/src/code/MyGame/MyGame.java).

Requires a half-decent terminal that supports the ANSI escape codes (e.g.
does not work with IntelliJ, works with vscode).
